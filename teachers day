On this day we remember the examplary people, 
who have guided us through our journey.
Everyday without fail
They enter our classes all ready for lessons
Sometimes stern, sometimes energetic, sometimes funny. 
But they share 
a burning passion for teaching
They are the inspiration, the spark, the candle, the guiding light
The pillars of sucess in our classrooms,
the ones who have deidcated their lives
to teach.

Comma splices, run-on sentences, speling errors
that's what she says. 
The power of English, 
helps us to get by in our daily conversations. 
It helps us express ourselves,
yet I find it troublesome
