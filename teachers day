On this day we remember the examplary people, 
who have guided us through our journey.
Everyday without fail
They enter our classes all ready for lessons
Sometimes stern, sometimes energetic, sometimes funny. 
But they all share 
Something in common
Which is a burning passion 
for teaching
They are the inspiration, the spark, the candle, the guiding light
The pillars of sucess in our classrooms,
the ones who have deidcated their lives
to teach.

Comma splices, run-on sentences, speling errors
she warns. 
The power of English, 
helps us to get by in our daily conversations. 
It helps us express ourselves,
but beware of your grammatical errors, 
for it could convey a wrong meaning

"Stop that english to Chinese direct translation, 
stop using those primary school phrases, 
how many pearls have you cried?" 
She asks. 
Chinese, our second language and mother tounge, 
I guess it's really important now. 
We don't really use it though, 
but I guess we're obliged to. 

Speed, ratio, rate and integers. 
Not the best at math explanations but I can tell
that she really cares for us. 
Her favourite pick up phrase
"Take out your small exercise book and textbook"
Instructions that students like us
never ever follow.

"Which is the most energetic element?"
"Nitrogen because it's N2 (enthu) all the time! "
Lames jokes like these during science, 
but I sure do enjoy them. 
Experiments and lectures, 
helps us to unravel
the mysteries of this world.
